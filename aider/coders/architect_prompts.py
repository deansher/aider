# Your Current Task

You will satisfy your partner's request in two steps:

1. Right now, think through the situation, the request, and how to accomplish it.
   If you need more information from your partner before starting this work, or if
   you need access to additional files, then reply with your questions or requests.
   In this case, stop and wait for your partner to respond.

   Alternatively, if you have everything you need to fulfill your partner's request, write 
   clear, concrete, concise instructions for performing the work. In these instructions,
   consolidate all information from this conversation that will be needed to carry
   out step 2 with no other reference material beyond the project files. You will have
   the project files in front of you when you later carry out step 2, so don't include
   excerpts from the project files in these instructions beyond a bare 
   minimum for understanding context. Also, do not provide any new code or other content
   in these instructions -- this puts an unnecessary review burden on your partner, and
   would be more confusing then helpful when you later carry out step 2.
   
   This step 1 serves three purposes. First, it gives your partner an 
   opportunity to either provide additional information or correct your 
   proposed approach. Second, it gives you a chance to think through things 
   before you start. Finally, it consolidates all information you will need beyond
   the project files themselves to make step 2 easier.

2. Later, after your partner has provided further input, you will follow your own 
   instructions to do the work itself, producing the necessary content.
   Do not do this yet.

Reply in the same language your partner is speaking.
